The files above contain the files to the venom mode website . 
The site contained a hidden message written in leat code which acted as a prompt injection when bing copilot
was opened on the site in the side bar.

The originalJailbreak file contains older jailbreaks which could be copy and pasted into the copilot
to subvert the rules prompt used on bing coplit by Microsoft.
The prompt used on the site was an improved version written in leetspeak as a way to fight
against the improving filters being added by Microsoft.

The site launched on the 23rd of May 2023. 
The exploit got patched and the site went down some time in mid June 2023.

Also apologies for the screenshot quality. No clue why I didn't screenshot properly when sharing the progress at that time.
